{"name":"Ccv-tbeta","tagline":"First beta of CCV (computer vision software) cross platform solution.","body":"_Community Core Vision_ or _CCV_ for short (also known as _tbeta_), is a open source/cross-platform solution for computer vision and machine sensing. It takes an video input stream and outputs tracking data (e.g. coordinates and blob size) and events (e.g. finger down, moved and released) that are used in building nui aware applications. CCV can interface with various web cameras and video devices as well as connect to various TUIO/OSC/XML enabled applications and supports many multi-touch lighting techniques including: FTIR, DI, DSI, and LLP with expansion planned for the future vision applications (custom modules/filters).\r\n\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/tbeta)\r\n\r\nShowcase:<br/>\r\n[![youtube showcase](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/30157683/nuigroup/tbeta1.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ysq3XAsKcuE)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2008 project\r\n<br/>\r\n![GSoC 2008](http://db.tt/7q0G6unN)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Seth Sandler\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Christian Moore","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
